The program svm.py will read the file optdigits.tra (3,823 samples) that includes training instances of handwritten digits (optically recognized). 
The program builds multiple SVM classifiers using this data.It simulates a grid search, trying to find which combination of four SVM hyperparameters (c,
degree, kernel, and decision_function_shape) leads you to the best prediction performance. To test the accuracy of those distinct models, 
I use the file optdigits.tes (1,797 samples).
