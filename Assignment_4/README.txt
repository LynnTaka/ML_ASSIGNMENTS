perceptron.py
Complete the Python program (perceptron.py) that will read the file optdigits.tra to build a
Single Layer Perceptron and a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. You will compare their performances
and test which combination of two hyperparameters (learning rate and shuffle) leads you to the best
prediction performance for each classifier. To test the accuracy of those distinct models, you will use
the file optdigits.tes. You should update and print the accuracy of each classifier, together with the
hyperparameters when it is getting higher.

deep_learning.py
Complete the Python program (deep_learning.py) that will learn how to
classify fashion items. You will use the dataset Fashion MNIST, which includes 70,000 grayscale
images of 28Ã—28 pixels each, with 10 classes, each class representing a fashion item as illustrated
below. You will use Keras to load the dataset which includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for
test. Your goal is to train and test multiple deep neural networks and check their corresponding
performances, always updating the highest accuracy found. This time you will use a separate function
named build_model() to define the architectures of your neural networks. Finally, the weights of the
best model will be printed, together with the architecture and the learning curves. To install TensorFlow
use: python -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow.
